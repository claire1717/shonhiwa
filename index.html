        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Child marriages refers to any formal or informal union regardless if one or both parties are under the age of 18 .
        It is the violation of human rights and particularly affect girls  depriving them of their childhood and leads to school

         and increased vulnerability to domestic violence .</p>
        <p><br>In Zimbabwe, child marriage remains a significant issue, particularly affecting girls.More than 20% of girls aged 15 
            to 18 years and even below are currently in a union.This statistics  clearly shows a sharp rural-urban divide , with two
            in five women in rural  areas getting married before 18 years , compared to one to five in urban areas like Harare.
            Specially, in Harare, 21.7% of girls are married bt the age of 18, reflecting the persistent challenge of child marriage 
            in urban settings</br></p>
